## Feedback/Questions/Reports Workflow

To get your feedback, please follow the following workflow.

### Check if your issue was not already posted
To make sure we don't get duplicates, make sure no one had the same bug or question as you did. If you do have the same bug, please just comment a "+1" or answer directly in the related issue.

### File a Github issue and fill-out the issue template.  
Four major types of feedback are welcome:
 * Bug reports
 * Feature requests
 * Loves / Hates: features you like, features which don't make sense, features you thought another way
 * UX reports: things that don't feel natural or easy to understand
You can also share any opinion or ask any question.

All issues should be using one or several of the following tags:
[Bug] [Feature] [Improvement] [Discussion] [UX]

### Watch the github repository to follow the issue

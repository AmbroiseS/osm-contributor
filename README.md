## OpenStreetMap Contributor App Feature & Issue tracker

### About the App
The Openstreetmap Contributor app allows anyone to contribute to OSM. It enables those-who-know to easily manage a group of newbies as the contribution process is intuitive and easy.  
Bring your MapParties to a whole new level!  

### How it works
For years, we have been using apps that do everything. For OSM, it means: add any node/way, edit, delete, comment, tag...
The hardest thing is that an amenity is not constrained to any model.  
If it does not really raise any issue for a desktop use, it is challenging when it comes to mobile contribution.  

The approach proposed here is a little different, even though it stays compliant with the classical approach:  
 1 - Go on the website and select a contribution zone  
 2 - Load all amenities of the zone, or manually declare the amenity model  
 3 - Generate the custom contributor app  
 4 - Give it to your team, play, and start mapping!  

### Beta instances
Until the final release (scheduled June 30th 1PM GMT), sample instances will be launched for the StateOfTheMap FR, US, and other innovation/map related events. The links below references those endpoints.  
@Community: We are grateful for any feedback you might have on either the frontend or the mobile apps. Go crazy and let us know!

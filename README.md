### About the App
The Openstreetmap Contributor app allows anyone to contribute to OSM. It enables those-who-know to
easily manage a group of newbies as the contribution process is intuitive and easy.  
The App comes in three flavours: store (for the Android Store version), poi-storage (for MapSquare
POI Databases), and template (for the osm.mapsquare.io tool for Mapping parties).  
Bring your MapParties to a whole new level!

### How it works
For years, we have been using apps that do everything. For OSM, it means: add any node/way, edit,
delete, comment, tag... The hardest thing is that an amenity is not constrained to any model.  
If it does not really raise any issue for a desktop use, it is challenging when it comes to mobile
contribution.

The approach proposed here is a little different, even though it stays compliant with the classical
approach:

 1. Go on the website and select a contribution zone
 2. Load all amenities of the zone, or manually declare the amenity model
 3. Generate the custom contributor app
 4. Give it to your team, play, and start mapping!

### Beta instances
